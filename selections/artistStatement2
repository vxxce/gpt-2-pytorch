"Utterly Persuaded by a Stone" is a collection of paintings by local artist Zachary Olpin. The collection was motivated by a kind of denialist ontology of objects. All paintings are abstract paintings, because objects do not exist. The object is only a concept (or a set of objects). A painting is a form of abstraction, and not a concept.

A painting's concept is an abstraction (a concept). The object is the form of abstraction. If a painting is abstract, the concept is not, and the object is not a concept.

Objects are abstract, so if a painting is abstract, then the concept is not abstract.

The subject is an abstract object, but the concept is not abstract.

The object is a set of objects, but the concept is not a concept.

The object is a set of objects, but the concept is not a concept.
